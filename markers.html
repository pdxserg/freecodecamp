<!-- Step 16Passed
To give the markers different colors, you will need to add a unique class to each one. Multiple classes can be added to an element by listing them in the class attribute and separating them with a space. For example, the following adds both the animal and dog classes to a div element.

<div class="animal dog">
If you add multiple classes to an HTML element, the styles of the first classes you list may be overridden by later classes.

To begin, add the class one to the first marker div element. -->


<div class="marker one">
</div>
<div class="marker">
</div>
<div class="marker">
</div>
